Ancient projects I found on my hard drive:
 - android: 3 Android games I helped to create in a mobile programming class.
   This was for the very first G1 handset, so they are assuredly woefully out
   of date now.
 - Chomper: A Pacman clone which uses C++ and SDL.
 - CrazyBlocks: A tetris clone which uses SDL.
 - cryptogrammer: A cryptogtram generator which uses Ocaml and GTK+.
 - gfx: A set of small programs I created for a graphics class.  They all
   involve a 3D penguin.
 - Mandrill: The very first (awful) compiler I ever wrote for an independent
   study.  It compiles a langauge called Mandrill I invented down to MIPS
   assembly.
 - PowerBreakout: A breakout clone created with C++ and SDL.
 - SimLib
