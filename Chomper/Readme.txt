Thanks for downloading Chomper!
Welcome to the exciting world of poorly written Pac-Man rip-offs!
But seriously, I think that for a Pac-Man clone, this one is pretty fun.
If you would like to write your own levels for Chomper, you can download
the Level Editor from my site.  If you make a sweet one, email it to me and
I'll include it with the game (and give you credit)!  After all, the ones I made
are pretty lame.

This program is released under the MIT.

If you have any trouble at all, email me at finlaysoni@gmail.com

Enjoy
