Thanks for downloading the Chomper level editor!
You must compile this separately because the Level.cpp
and Level.h files are not the same!

It is really terrible to use. You must remember the number
for the block...	ONLY LOAD THIS WITH WORDPAD!!!

To load and save, leave off the .chl extension. So to load level1.chl
just type level1 in the file name field.

Because of the backasswards way I set up the levels, a wall can be only "half" filled in.
To make level designing less tedious, there is a "Validate" Button. It prevents this
by filling in the gaps.

Enjoy!
